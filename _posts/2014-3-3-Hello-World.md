Hello, world!

Finally moving on from Wordpress into Jekyll. The reason for moving on from wordpress into Jekyll is because, I was too lazy to set up my own wordpress web hosting and also the `wordpress.com` blog was not going to let me to use the syntax highlighter for writing down a code snippet. So yeah, that's way I'm moving into static Jekyll page which also forked from other people GitHub repo. I just want to write!

So, to commemorate this beginning, let's write a simple code snippet :) 

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Class Selectors</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">

        <div class="block-container bg-gray-medium">
            <div class="header text-center">
                <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block-container bg-gray-medium">
            <p class="text-gray-light font-italic">
                CSS selectors let you <span class="font-normal text-bold">select</span> individual HTML elements in an HTML
                document. This is <span class="text-bold">super</span> useful.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="block-container bg-gray-medium">
            <p>
                Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select
                arbitrary boxes in your web pages.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block-container bg-gray-medium">
            <p>
                We’ll also be talking about links in this example, so here’s
                <a href='https://internetingishard.com'>Interneting Is Hard</a> for us to
                style.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="btn btn-normal btn-border btn-centered text-white text-center">Button One</div>

        <div class="btn btn-cta btn-border btn-centered text-white text-center font-italic ">Button Two</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
