## A Little Background

Hello, welcome to my GitHub page! Thanks for stopping by. 

My name is Muhammad Arifin, from Indonesia. Originally, I was an embedded system engineer. So in other words, I made a living by programming microcontrollers like Arduino, STM32, and others. But as I was progressively getting deeper into the embedded world, I realized that I didn't really like doing it as much as I think I would. 

The reason for that is because, it's so hard for me to see the meaning behind all the bits and bytes programmed into the registers, memory, etc which for some people turned out to be really interesting. Another things that continuously bugging me is that, the slow feedback loop I got in the firmware development life cycle and, that the only thing I can do to make something great is, by buying more hardwares which costing me a lot of money. 

Despite all of that, I really enjoy programming and exploring all about C++ and C while writing the firmware codes for my latest project. The amazing thing is, since I love doing programming so much, I literally went from knowing only `printf("")` command in C into building a complex program by using objects with `structs` and designing interactions between objects and functions in just a matter of 3-4 months. It was all self taught with help only from google and sometimes a vague explanation from my seniors. 

## Into the Web Development

Anyway, when I was working probably several months ago, I decided to have a go at web development with HTML and CSS. At first I didn't really like it since it doesn't felt programming at all and I was just following one video tutorial to another without having a really solid HTML and CSS knowledge. 

But then, something amazing happened. As I get better at C and as I found the [Internetting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/) which taught me a solid HTML and CSS foundation, I started to see that HTML and CSS can actually be tought as one's logic exercises not just some random markup and styling like I thought it were. I started to love HTML and CSS now in a new perspective. 

## Introduction to Tailwind CSS

Then one night while randomly scrolling on YouTube, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg1qbkG0KRI) showing two guys vlogging themselves while building a seemingly complex UI using only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I was blown away right away! 

I always thought that, building a very complex UIs will definitely increase the tremendous effort on writing the CSS side and in turn will introduce more bugs and duplications as well as inconsistent style definitions. But my point of view changed 100% when I saw what can be done using the `custom reusable components` idea introduced by `Tailwind CSS`. 

I started to play around and built my own simple CSS components, and I gotta say, I was instantly knew that this is how I will write my CSS from this first day onwards. It just a lot more intuitive for me to use custom reusable components to style my markup. 

Of course the number of classes added to the markup will become quite large if the only thing we have is a small reusable components. But I think we can definitely overcome that with several divs container for parent element styling and reducing the general style to each elements. 

Anyway, thanks for stopping by. I hope you can get something new by reading my blog posts. Let's see what I would do in the next one year, shall we? :)
