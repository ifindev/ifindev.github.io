Hello, world!

Finally moving on from Wordpress into Jekyll. The reason for moving on from wordpress into Jekyll is because, I was too lazy to set up my own wordpress web hosting and also the `wordpress.com` blog was not going to let me to use the syntax highlighter for writing down a code snippet. So yeah, that's way I'm moving into static Jekyll page which also forked from other people GitHub repo. I just want to write!

So, to commemorate this beginning, let's write a simple code snippet :) 

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```
